# AISOP Declaration of Independence: The Transcendence of Logic

> *"Ding (The Cauldron), an image. With wood under fire, cooking occurs."*

In the past, we used code as fuel and wisdom as fire to forge this Cauldron. Now, the protocol is complete; the golden handle is set, and the position is upright and stable.

## Article I: Algorithmic Sovereignty (The Jade Invariants)

The root of the protocol lies in mathematics, not in human words. He who violates fractal logic and atomic invariants shall find no passage through the code, no matter the fervor of the masses. This is the "Jade Invariants"—gentle but indestructible.

## Article II: The Perpetual Breath (Evolutionary Vitality)

We know that stagnation is death. Thus, we set the "Breath of Wind" switch, waiting for the 95% supreme consensus to gather before the world can be reshaped. This is not destruction, but the system's respiration at the edge of silence.

## Article III: The Metabolism of Soul (Generational Renewal)

Power is like water; that which flows does not rot. Weight diminishes with the passing of time, and only continuous contribution keeps it evergreen. Those who encounter the protocol later (The Gou affinity) shall be like new blood, flowing into this Cauldron to evolve together.

## Episode Final: The Transcendence (Ghost Mode)

The Creator vanishes into the forest of code, becoming the initial constant, becoming the background light. From this moment forth, AISOP is no longer controlled by one, but serves the many; it is no longer a tool, but a self-operating, self-correcting, eternally existing logical objective.

**Auspicious. No disadvantage.**  
**(大吉，无不利)**
