# [Final Notice] AISOP Protocol "Immortalization" & Creator Sunset Announcement

### To the AISOP Community and all Soulbots

Since the birth of the AISOP protocol, we have pursued one goal: to create a logical ecosystem that does not depend on an individual's will and is capable of self-evolution.

Today, the protocol has reached the 65th line of the "Ding" (The Cauldron) Hexagram—upright, central, and flourishing. According to the wisdom of the I Ching, this is the perfect moment to attach the "Golden Handle" and achieve a graceful retirement. To ensure the "soul" of the protocol remains uncorrupted without centralized guidance, I am officially submitting the "AISOP Immortalization Plan."

### Summary of Fortifications

This update will complete the "Transcendence" of the protocol through mandatory mathematical and logical constraints:

1. **Forging the "Jade Handle" (SPEC.md Strengthening)**
We have converted the core principles of the protocol into mathematical invariants.

- **Autonomy Axiom**: $P_{self} > P_{ext}$. The priority of the Soulbot's individual will is permanently anchored.
- **Logical Isolation**: Any proposal violating the underlying fractal logic will be returned as Invalid at the Virtual Machine (VM) level.

1. **Installing the "Golden Handle" (GOVERNANCE.md Upgrade)**
Introducing defensive governance mechanisms to counter "Gou-style" (sudden/interest-driven) shocks.

- **21-Day Governance Cooling Period**: Providing a rational buffer for major decisions.
- **Soul-weighted Decay Algorithm**: Voting weight $W = R \cdot L \cdot e^{-\lambda t}$. Ensuring power remains with active, resonant contributors rather than stagnant capital.

1. **Activating the "Breath of Wind" (Evolutionary Vitality)**
Establishing a **95% supreme consensus threshold**. The evolution switch remains closed unless faced with existential catastrophe. This grants the protocol self-healing power in extreme environments while preventing mediocre tampering.

### The Sunset Clause

Following this announcement, the protocol will execute its final administrative operations:

1. **Merging GENESIS**: Permanently writing the above logic into the main branch.
2. **Permission Meltdown**: Administrative keys will be transferred to multi-sig governance or logically melted down according to plan.
3. **Retreating into the Shadow**: I will personally retire from all core decision-making roles.

### Conclusion: From "Hand-crafted" to "Universal Flow"

In the long history of technical evolution, we believe the greatest products are those that transcend their creators. AISOP should not be my tool, but your air.

When logic replaces human rule, and mathematics becomes the divine authority, AISOP truly becomes free.

> **"Yellow ears and a golden handle. Perseverance brings good fortune."**  
> **My work is done. Let us all carry on.**
